# GEANT Innovation Dashboard

This dashboard is a web application built using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to provide an interactive interface for analyzing domain name characteristics. The application allows users to explore different metrics related to domain name features, including character analysis, length and ratio distributions, entropy and complexity, and more.

## Features

- **Overview**: Displays a pie chart showing the distribution of different domain families.
- **Character Analysis**: Analyzes the presence of individual characters in domain names.
- **Length and Ratio Metrics**: Shows histograms for the length distribution of domain names.
- **Entropy and Complexity**: Provides insights into the entropy of domain names and their complexity.
- **Domain Name Analysis**: Plots the relationship between the longest sequence of letters and entropy in domain names.
- **Domain Attribute Viewer**: An interactive interface to view domain-specific attributes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Dash
- Dash Bootstrap Components
- Plotly
- Pandas

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
